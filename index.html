	<h2>Favorite Video Games</h2> 
	 <p>
	 My favorite video game right now is Black Ops IIII, the reason why it is my favorite game is because it has a zombies gamemode where you survive with three other teamates. Fortnite used to be my favorite game until Black Ops came out.

	<h2>Hobbies</h2> 
	 <p> 
	 My hobbies are spending time with my friends, playing basketball, and playing videogames. My friends and I, Nick and Spencer, joined the 3v3 tournament basketball tournament at our high school and we won the championhip game and our record was 6-1. Also with my friends we went out a lot to the beach, dinners, and parties.
